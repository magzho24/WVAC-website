            <p>The Westwood Firemen’s Ambulance Service was formed in 1935 with 20 members serving the entire Pascack Valley. The ambulance was owned and operated solely by the firemen. Since then the corps has grown to ___ volunteer members that include EMTs, EMRs, CPR-aids, and more. Right now, WVAC is a volunteer organization, meaning that no member is paid for their service or time. We operate with income from three sources:  donations of residents and businesses, our annual Carnival, and a donation from the Borough of Westwood. Each member of WVAC gives up a day of their week to serve Westwood by riding on the ambulance.</p>

        </div>

        <p>The Westwood Firemen’s Ambulance Service was formed in 1935 with 20 members serving the entire Pascack Valley. The ambulance was owned and operated solely by the firemen. By the summer for 1935, 21 firemen had passed the American Red Cross course taught by Jacob Goldswer of the Bergen County Police, and Westwood Volunteer Ambulance Corps was formed. In July 1935, WVAC's first ambulance was purchased and responded to its first 911 emergency on July 18. The corps first emergency was a serious motor vehicle crash in Hillsdale in which 4 patients were taken to the nearest hospital, Hackensack Hospital.</p>
        <p>Westwood Mayor Hopper stated, ”I believe [WVAC] is the first town in Bergen County to have such a service.”  This was true, and over 95% of the families in Westwood contributed to the corps after its opening. </p>
        <p>After an accident, a new Chrysler ambulance was purchased for $2,400, in 1939, and 13 years later, in February of 1952, a new Cadillac ambulance purchased for about $5,000.</p>
        

        <p>In 1960, the WVAC celebrated its 25th anniversary. By this time, the corps had responded to 6,246 emergencies. At the 25th Anniversary dinner, a speech was delivered. “The ambulance also gives to the individual an opportunity to serve humanity.  There is nothing so self-satisfying as the feeling that one has rendered a distinctive service to someone and to a cause.  To make one’s heart a little lighter, to make ones’ life a little brighter, by our own individual efforts is far more important... [A] real tribute to this service comes from the grateful hearts of those who have had to call for the ambulance.  It is a silent tribute, but is a tribute what is sincere and permanent, which nothing can destroy.  That gratitude is enough for whatever efforts and service we may have given.  To feel that you are part of saving a life... in restoring life and happiness to a distressed family is the highest tribute anyone can receive.”</p>
        
        <p>By July of 1965, with 30 years of service to Westwood and the Pascack Valley, the WVAC had responded to 7,469 emergencies.</p>
        
        <p>In 1973, the Corps separated from the Westwood Fire Department.  Headquarters was relocated to what is today the Westwood Community Center Storage Room. By 1975, 40 years after its establishment, the Westwood Volunteer Ambulance Corps, Inc. was incorporated as an independent organization.</p>
        <p>In the Spring of 2008, the old Excellence ambulance was retired, and a new Horton ambulance was purchased and placed in service. The new ambulance is currently still in use and is owned entirely by the WVAC. The corps also purchased a first responder vehicle in December of 2010, after a donated first responder vechile was wrecked in a MVC. </p>
